    <h2>About Iris</h2>
    <p>
        Iris is a Chinese TV drama and bubble tea addict. As a Canadian born Chinese,
        she is always trying improve her Cantonese and Mandarin language skills. If possible,
        she would like to brush up on Japanese, and self-learn the languages Thai and Korean. 
        To maintain a balanced life, she enjoys bullet journaling to de-stress and stay organized.
        Her bullet journaling journey started in 2017, inspired by her friend who does handlettering, 
        and bullet journalists on Instagram.
